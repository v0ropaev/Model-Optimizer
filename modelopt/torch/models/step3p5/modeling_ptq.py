    The Step family (``stepfun-ai/Step-3.5-Flash``, ``stepfun-ai/Step-3.7-Flash``) ships a
    custom ``MoELinear`` via ``trust_remote_code``: a plain ``nn.Module`` holding a single
    ``weight`` of shape ``[num_experts, out_features, in_features]``, whose
    ``forward(x, expert_id)`` runs ``F.linear`` against the selected expert's slice. The
    weights therefore live on the projection submodule rather than on the expert container,
    which is what :func:`_fused_experts_wrapper_class` looks for, and the module is not an
    ``nn.Linear``, so neither the fused-experts path nor the plain linear path claims it.

    Detection is structural rather than keyed on class names so new Step revisions are picked
    up without another hardcoded name, but the shape alone is not a sufficient contract: the
    replacement forward indexes ``self.experts[expert_id]``, so it only works for callers that

    attribute set while passing a per-expert token-count *tensor* instead (e.g. Moondream3's
    ``MoeFusedLinear.forward(input, m_sizes)``, which would raise ``TypeError: only integer
    tensors of a single element can be converted to an index`` on the first calibration
    forward). The second parameter must therefore be named ``expert_id``, which is the
